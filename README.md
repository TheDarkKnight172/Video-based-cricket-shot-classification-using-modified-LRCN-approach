# Video-Based-Cricket-Shot-Classification-Using-Modified-LRCN-Approach
This report shows the development of a machine learning model for cricket shot classification from video data, employing a modified Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) based model. This model achieved accuracies as high as 95% when trained. It involved designing and implementing the model's structure, incorporating layers such as LSTM and CNN to effectively capture temporal and spatial features from the video data.
